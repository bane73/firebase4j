OpenStates4j

Note: THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ALPHA.


REQUIREMENTS

	In order to use this project, you must first acquire a Sunlight Labs API Key.
	You can obtain a key by visiting http://services.sunlightlabs.com

	You should also review the Open States API documentation, as this interface
	is only meant to provide a thin wrapper around it and should (hopefully) 
	closely mirror it.
	
	All of the Objects, methods, and parameters represented by the API are 
	similarly represented by this wrapper.  Optional (and new) fields exposed 
	by the API will be found in a map (`'optionalProperties'`) on each Object.

	The API documentation can be found at http://openstates.org/api/


EXAMPLE

	OpenStates.setApiKey( {YOUR_SUNLIGHT_LABS_API_KEY} );
	
	// find all Districts for the state of California
	List<District> allCaliforniaDistricts = District.find( "ca" );
	
	// find all NY's upper-house Bills that have been updated since 01Jan2012
	Map<String, String> queryParams = new HashMap<String, String>();
	queryParams.put( "state", "ny" );
	queryParams.put( "updated_since", "2012-01-01" );
	queryParams.put( "chamber", "upper" );
	List<Bill> allRecentBillsInNyUpperHouse = Bill.find( queryParams );

	// find a specific Bill
	Bill aBill = allRecentBillsInNyUpperHouse.get(0);
	Bill targetBill = Bill.get( aBill.state, aBill.session, aBill.id );
	
	// finding Legislator's that represent a specific geo-area
	List<Legislator> geoLegislators = Legislator.find( "-78.76648", "35.81336" );
	
	// accessing a Legislator's properties
	Legislator legislator = geoLegislators.get(0);
	String id = legislator.id;
	String fullName = legislator.fullName;
	String email = legislator.email;
	boolean isActive = legislator.isActive;
